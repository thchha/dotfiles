TITLE:
# A Big Bold Title To Check Underscores

CONTENT:
This is some text i should load, parse and then display.
There are a some requirements which make the task more difficult:
When on the blog-index all listed posts should contain a little preview.
This preview has to be read from this file and parsed in appropriate spots.
This implies that the structure of this file has to be fixed or the
_implementation_ may break. Furthermore the filename needs to be used as a link
to navigate to - this will introduce, for sure, further complexity. We will
see. On and by the way.. 

```lua
function test() 
	local display = "to_"
	return display .. "some formatted code"
end
```

## Some second title - Have fun parsing

</br>
OH, that was an html tag, which should work 'native' ;- )

*Have fun!*
