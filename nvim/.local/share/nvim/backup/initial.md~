# blog?.say("Hello World!")

Wow, that was kind of complex. Once I have written out all my scripts for
querying my timetable database, I will paste in the time spend on it. But
overall, it was definitely more than thirty hours. Just considering writing back- and front-end, but setting up the infrastructure etc...

### Why not just a static site?

I wanted to familiarize myself with the techniques/methods used for web
development. And I picked up hell-a-lot. And I built a minimal framework for my
private use-case: Running a dynamic server on my raspberry pi without
trade-offs.

- setting up web server
- read up upon web technologies
- applying TLS to it
- manage permissions and groups on linux
- read up upon web technologies (wow, resources are just bloated with crap)
- configure the webserver for delegating to my backend
- start writing the actual backend
- parse the html-content on server site
- apply css to the website
- parse, cut, chunk, chop and flex training for urls
- deploy database
- parse markdown
- write a blog post.

Let me say this in advance: The effort spent can not be justified. So many, way
more important, things have been put aside for this. Luckily my current visitors
are just crawlers/hackers, so I do not feel too ashamed for this first draft post! 
But even you guys: I placed some notes in case you guys want to revisit some
things as well. In case you are a person and even in favour with me: **Thanks
for your visit!**

## Content, please...

Yeah, short abstract: 
This thing here, called `Hage's Lua Box v.0.1` is build upon: 
[Debian](https://www.debian.org/) ARM-64-bit headless +
[lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net/) 1.4 +
a lua-application which uses [luasocket](http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/) + [lqlite](https://github.com/maxdoom-com/lsqlite.git) - and that's it. 

> use `curl` or your browser to get this string!

Okay, now let's give you some content...

First thing you will learn is: There are already plenty of solutions available, free or
paid - But finding them requires the correct wording and your own requirements.
So this project helped me get there. 

> Did you know the difference between [Netty](https://netty.io/) and [TomCat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) or even Lighttpd? 
> What about [spring-boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) or [micronaut](https://micronaut.io/)?

Webservers need to be started as root. This is due to the ports used
when you want to make your site available to the public. 

> Check which ports require root permissions on Linux.

After opening your ports, be aware that you just entered _the_ war zone. Hopefully you
are prepared. Within the first night opening my ports, I heard my discs roaring,
buzzing and vibrating. I was wondering if I just recognized these sounds.. 

> learn about `lsof` and other network utilities.

So, the next day, I started researching how to display current connections on my linux server. And I have found plenty of connections displayed with the user: **root**. Here I have to mention: My ssh-config was already restricted to ssh-keys. Anyways, some of these IPs were unknown to me.

### As time goes by, an eye for an eye - We in this together son, your beef is mines 

Okay - Somehow - this guy was logged on as root on my pi, even though I thought
my permissive configuration was sufficient. Anyways! I am capable of
some CLI-power as well (ha, I guess) - so don't worry and fight back!
I started with my first skill: redirection! 

> file descriptors and redirections

After storing the output of `lsof` in a file, I rebooted. Haahaha, know you
have to start your attack all-over! Right? Right??

> Read upon various security things, procrastinate and feel uncomfortable.

Anyhow. I searched for his IP-address via google (measurements! Do not consulate
this giant. My two cents `(for now!! =)`) and got one result. Him/her/them has to be some chinese folk, aweful bloated website with... I can't read Chinese. I haven't even installed chinese
encodings.. And my CLI-powers appeared to vanish..

> change any port from default to something.. other. And be permissive when
> allowing _specific_ ports to be forwarded to _specific_ machines.

### My current achievements
Setup a website, get attacked every hour (which only results in 2 seconds of ping-spikes before rejecting further
access to my boxes) and be afraid that at some point somebody will get access
without myself recognizing it. Once a human starts fighting, he adapts pretty fast.
I get daily new ideas to survive in this war. Unfortunately time is limited...
My advice is: Do not underestimate the attacks you will encounter. Only join
this war if you have built your defense and - hopefully we won't face eachother as enemies.. (or again, dear hackers).

## to be continued.. ;- )
