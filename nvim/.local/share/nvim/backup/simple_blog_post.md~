TITLE:
# This is a second file, testing the parsing capabilities

SUMMARY:
Instead of providing the content as the preview, I could instead write
an abstract which can be used as the preview. 

CONTENT:
All keywoards in ALLCAPS within this file needs to be ignored when reading it.
This will require an dedicated reader. Note also: within
this file the tag UPDATED is absent.
When reading the file we should maybe strip the markdown syntax or
translate it beforehand.

```lua
function test() 
	local display = "to_"
	return display .. "some formatted code"
end
```

## Maybe a secondary title can be included into the preview?

Well, I guess an dedicated abstract is more appropriate, since it avoids
dupllication of the content. We will see how far I can go with this.
